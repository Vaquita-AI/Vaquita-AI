## Projects
- **Computer Vision**:
  - [Rocket Objects Detection](https://github.com/Vaquita-AI/Rocket-Objects-Detection): Developed a robust YOLOv8m-based model to accurately identify and localize various rocket components. Achieved an overall precision of 0.835 and mAP50 of 0.826. Demonstrated the model's capability on a real-world video: [ULA Atlas V launch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVRCdFLpDaE).
  - [Recyclable and Household Waste Image Classification](https://github.com/Vaquita-AI/Recyclable-and-Household-Waste-Image-Classification): Developed and fine-tuned a deep learning model based on the EfficientNet B3 architecture for accurate classification of waste types from images. Achieved a test accuracy of 93.54%.
  - [Butterfly Species Image Classification](https://github.com/Vaquita-AI/Butterfly-Image-Classification): Developed and fine-tuned a deep learning model based on the ResNet50 architecture for accurate classification of butterfly species from images. Achieved a test accuracy of 94.62%.
- **Data Science & Supervised Learning**:
  - [Predictive Modeling for Diabetes](https://github.com/Vaquita-AI/Diabetes-Prediction): Developed and evaluated various ML models to predict diabetes based on medical and demographic features. Achieved 90% F1 score with XGBoost and CatBoost classifiers.
  - [Wine Quality Classification](https://github.com/Vaquita-AI/Wine-Quality-Classification): Developed and optimized a classification model to predict wine quality based on a Kaggle dataset. Achieved a prediction accuracy of 75.11%.
- **Time Series Forecasting**:
  - [Gold Price Prediction](https://github.com/Vaquita-AI/Gold-Price-Prediction): Developed and evaluated models to predict the next day's gold price. Linear Regression had the best performance (MAE: 12.40 USD), with LSTM also performing well. Highlighted the challenges of financial market prediction and the need for additional features for better accuracy.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
  - [Machine Translation (English > German)](https://github.com/Vaquita-AI/Machine-Translation-EN-DE): Experimented with a hand-coded Transformer-based model for translating English text to German. Achieved a BLEU score of 0.0149 on the validation set.
  - [SMS Spam Detection](https://github.com/Vaquita-AI/SMS-Spam-Detection): Developed a classification system to detect spam messages in SMS text data using Naive Bayes classifiers and text vectorization methods. Achieved a classification accuracy of 98% on the test set.
